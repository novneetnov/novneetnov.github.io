  university: Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health
  mooc: Coursera
  description: This course focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner. Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them.

- name: Fundamentals of Computing Specialization
  certificate: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-90sIXVmb3jK3ThiFWXOgbFXDtcz5Jmm
  instructors: Scott Rixner, Joe Warren, Associate Professor
  course_link: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals
  university: Rice University
  mooc: Coursera
  description: This Specialization covers much of the material that first-year Computer Science students take at Rice University. Students learn sophisticated programming skills in Python from the ground up and apply these skills in building more than 20 fun projects. The Specialization concludes with a Capstone exam that allows the students to demonstrate the range of knowledge that they have acquired in the Specialization.
