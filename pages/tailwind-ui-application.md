# TAILWIND-UI APPLICATION
Its nice to write to you Team Tailwind. My name is Novneet and I am from India.
I have been developing software for almost 7 years now and in general I like to explore all technologies, 
which naturally made me a full-stack developer over time.

### MOTIVATION
In one of my recent projects, we decided to use Tailwind UI components. 
The designs are really neat and everyone was positive.
When the development team got the access and started working, we realized something we hadn’t thought of before. 
Using tailwind-UI with VueJS was taking a considerable amount of time. 
Before tailwind-UI we were accustomed to using material design frameworks like Vuetify 
which would make our lives so easy and save precious development time as well. 
Every time we wrote an input component, a button component, navbars we truly 
felt the need for a VueJS compatible framework. I am sure many other developers from React and Vue community must have felt that as well.
And when I saw this as a project you guys are considering seriously in the near future,
I thought what’s better than working with Tailwind authors directly to develop the libraries.


### QUICK TECH INTRO ABOUT ME

I have some decent experience in developing full-stack applications. 
The technologies I have used to do so are VueJS for the frontend and Ruby on Rails or Django framework for the Backend.
I also have limited (only basics) knowledge of Flutter, if we consider Mobile apps to be part of full-stack apps.

##### GIT REPOSITORIES
I have maintained a good number of projects in Git, with multiple people working on them simultaneously.
This gives me experience on how history could get messed up, sometimes irreparably, 
if the collaboration structures are not handled with proper care. 
I am seeing this skill would be very instrumental in managing and maintaining multiple tailwind Git repositories.

##### SCALABILITY
One of the major challenges in development is create scalable architecture. 
This means to make each individual component as dumb as possible and as independent as possible.
This takes time and effort in the immediate now, but it more than compensates by saving time and increasing joy in the long run.
I enjoy implementing the process of componentization, making small re-usable and scalable bits, 
and have applied it to projects across all the stacks (frontend, backend & mobile) I have used.
I would love to apply these skills in breaking down the repeated petterns into re-usable components in the tailwind project as well.

### THE FUTURE AND INTERESTS
I would like tailwindcss to be as widely used as material designs. Its one thing to be backed by Google.
But one sure way to do that is to have enough readymade yet customizable javascript components (like Datepickers, expansion panels etc)
available for the developers. I realize this is definitely a bit too futuristic, 
as the prior step is to have the javascript libraries ready. But this is where I want to see tailwind go.
And I am talking as a developer who would really want to use tailwind javascript components in his projects.

Another branch of technology that interests me a lot is Machine Learning. I am trying hard to keep up with the developments.
To enhance my base level of understanding I have enrolled in Deep Learning courses from Coursera.
I totally believe the AI is something that will revolutionize the world in the decades to come 
with more computing power and data in our hands.
At this point I am not sure how my interest is going to be beneficial to tailwind. If you have any idea, I would love to hear that.

In general the world of technology excites me. And the speed with which it moves and disrupts excites me some more. :)


### WHERE AND HOW I WORK NOW
I have been working on project to project basis with startups around the world for quite some time now.
Generally the contracts range from a few months upto a year. 
While the structure, paperwork & payment is seamless when the client is located in India,
the same cannot be said when the client is located outside. 
Working for clients outside India is considered as export and there are some different rules that kick in this scenario.

To deal with these problems, I (along with a partner) have formed a small company. 
[Evos Solutions Pvt. Ltd.](https://evossolutions.com/)
The role of the company is just to have a contract between the client company and Evos Solutions. 
This makes all paperwork & payment seamless.

### THANK YOU
Lastly, I would like to thank you for your time and going through this application.
You can contact me at [novneet@evossolutions.com](novneet@evossolutions.com) for anything you want to say. 
Your feedbacks are most welcome. Let me know you take on this as well.
