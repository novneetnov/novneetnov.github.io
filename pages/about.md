# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>

## I Love <3 Technology


## Where I work now
I currently serve as a Director & Chief Technology Officer at [Evos Solutions Pvt. Ltd](https://evossolutions.com/). I focus on designing & implementing architectures for developers in our team that outputs high quality and scalable software. I work with product owners and help the dev team understand the priorities for stakeholders. I identify the bottlenecks that silently creep up in a dev team and implement structures to remove them.
My responsibilities also include constantly upgrading my tech skills and guiding the team of developers to be ready for upcoming technologies.
